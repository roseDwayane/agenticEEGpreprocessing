     AutoGluon-Tabular: Robust and Accurate AutoML for Structured Data

A. AutoGluon Implementation Details

Default hyperparameter values used for each model can be found in the AutoGluon source code: github.com/
awslabs/autogluon. The implementation of each model and its hyperparameter values are located in the directory: autogluon/utils/tabular/ml/models/. These default hyperparameter values were chosen a priori and
not tuned based on the particular datasets used for benchmarking in this paper.
Implemented using MXNet Gluon, the neural network in AutoGluon employs ReLU activations, dropout regularization,
batch normalization, Adam with a weight decay penalty (Kingma & Ba, 2015), and early stopping based on validation
performance. While not tuned via hyperparameter optimization, the size of the hidden layers is nonetheless scaled adaptively
based on properties of the training data (in a fixed manner). In particular, the feedforward branch of our model uses hidden
layers of size 256 and 128 which are additionally scaled up based on the number of classes in multi-class settings. The width
of the numeric embedding layer ranges between 32 - 2056 and is determined based on the number of numeric features and
the proportion of numeric vs. categorical features. Inspired by Howard & Gugger (2020), a discrete feature with k unique
categories observed in the training data is processed by an embedding layer of size: 1.6 ˆ k 0.56 (up to threshold of size 100).
To ensure stable gradients in regression we rescale targets and use the L1 loss (even for mean-squared-error objectives).
While SeLU activations have demonstrated strong performance in tabular data applications (Klambauer et al., 2017), we
found them occasionally unreliable on data with peculiar characteristics, and opted to use simpler ReLU units for the sake of
robustness.
Model-specific data preprocessing for our neural network included the following steps. For numeric features: missing values
were imputed using the median, quantile normalization was applied to skewed distributions, and mean-zero unit-variance
rescaling was applied to all other variables. For categorical features: a separate “Unknown” category was introduced
for missing data as well as new categories encountered during inference, and an “Other” category was used to handle
high-cardinality features with ą 100 possible levels, where all rare categories were reassigned to “Other”. We only applied
our embedding layers to categorical features with at least 4 discrete levels (others were simply one-hot encoded and then
treated as numeric).

B. Data used in Kaggle Benchmark

Table S1 describes the datasets that comprised our Kaggle benchmark. Data for each competition can be obtained from its website: kaggle.com/c/x/ where x is the name of the competition specified in the table.
We selected data for the benchmark based on a few criteria. First, we aimed to include datasets for which Lu
(2019); Rishi (2019) previously demonstrated that GCP-Tables could produce strong results (indicating these are
suitable candidates for AutoML). These competitions included the following: allstate-claims-severity,
porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction,                 walmart-recruiting-trip-type-classification,
ieee-fraud-detection.           We decided not to include the other three datasets from Lu (2019) in our
benchmark because either the data are unavailable (criteo-display-ad-challenge), the competition
is no longer scoring predictions (mercari-price-suggestion-challenge), or the data require manual transformations to be formatted as a single table, without a clear canonical recipe to construct such a table
(kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose).
The remaining benchmark data were selected by optimizing for a mix of regression and binary/multiclass classification tasks
with IID data (i.e. without temporal dependence), while favoring competitions that were either more recent (indicating more
timely applications) or had a large number of teams competing (indicating more prominent applications). Here, we chose to
                                                               1

disregard competitions that provide multiple data files needing to be manually joined to obtain a single data table (except for
ieee-fraud-detection from Rishi (2019) which had an obvious join strategy). Typically based on domain-specific
knowledge, the precise manner in which such manual joins are conducted will heavily affect predictive performance, and
lies beyond the scope of current AutoML frameworks (which assume the data are contained within a single table). Beyond
formatting them into a single table as necessary and specifying ID columns when they are needed to submit predictions, the
data provided by Kaggle were otherwise not altered (no feature selection/engineering), in order to evaluate how our AutoML
frameworks perform on raw data. For posterity, Table S2 lists additional competitions that appear to fit our selection criteria,
but were ill-suited for the benchmark upon closer inspection.
Predictions submitted to a Kaggle competition receive two scores evaluated on private and public subsets of the test data. The
performance reported in this paper is based on the private score from each Kaggle competition, which is used to decide the
official leaderboard. An exception is the currently ongoing house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
competition for which we report public scores, as the private scores are not yet available (The leaderboard ranks achieved
by our AutoML frameworks on this competition are thus unreliable as many competitors game the public scores through
various exploits; public test scores nonetheless suffice for fair comparison of AutoML frameworks since our frameworks
solely access the test data to make predictions). Throughout our presented results, two methods’ performance is deemed
equal if their predictions were scored within 5 decimal places of each other.
Certain competitions used scoring metrics not supported by some of the AutoML frameworks in our evaluations. However,
by suitably processing the data, we were able to ensure every AutoML framework optimizes a metric monotonically related
to the true scoring function. For example, we log-transformed the y-values from competitions using the Root Mean Squared
Logarithmic Error, then specified that each AutoML frameworks should use the mean-squared error metric, and finally
applied the inverse transformation to their predictions before submitting them to Kaggle. Normalized Gini-index scoring
was handled by instead specifying the proportional AUC metric to each AutoML framework. Thus, each AutoML tool was
informed of the exact evaluation metric that would be employed and our comparisons are fully equitable.

C. Details Regarding Usage of AutoML frameworks

Code to reproduce our benchmarks is available here: github.com/Innixma/autogluon-benchmarking. Our
evaluations are based on running each AutoML system on every dataset in the exact same manner. Having to manually
adjust tools to particular datasets would otherwise undermine the purpose of automated machine learning.
Only H2O and GCP-Tables could robustly handle training with CSV files of raw data in our experiments (each utilizing their
own automated inference of feature types). While Auto-WEKA aims to do the same, our experiments produced numerous
errors when applying Auto-WEKA to raw data (e.g. when a new feature-category appeared in test data). To enhance its
robustness, we provided Auto-WEKA with the same preprocessed data that we provided to TPOT and auto-sklearn. Lacking
end-to-end AutoML capabilities, these packages do not support raw data input and require the data to be preprocessed. Thus,
we provided Auto-WEKA, TPOT, and auto-sklearn with the same preprocessed version of each dataset, producing via the
same steps AutoGluon uses to transform raw data into numerical features that are fed to certain models: Inferred categorical
features are restricted to only their top 100 categories, then one-hot encoded into a vector representation with additional
categories to represent rare categories, missing values, and new categories only encountered at inference-time. Inferred
numerical features have their missing values imputed and then are rescaled to zero mean and unit variance.
We find that given the AutoGluon-processed data, Auto-WEKA, TPOT, and auto-sklearn are able to match their performance
in the original AutoML benchmark (Table S3), this time without requiring that the feature types have been manually specified
for each package. As a commercial cloud service, GCP-Tables differed from the other tools in that it is fully automated with
no user-specified parameters to affect predictive performance beyond the given evaluation metric and time limits.
Where available, we used newer versions of each open-source AutoML framework than those Gijsbers et al. (2019) evaluated
in the original AutoML Benchmark. In particular, we used TPOT version 0.11.1, Auto-WEKA 2.6, H2O 3.28.0.1, and
auto-sklearn version5 0.5.2. For each of these AutoML libraries, we confirmed with the original package authors that any
modifications we made to the default AutoML benchmark settings would be improvements. The code to run each AutoML
tool is found in the autogluon utils/benchmarking/baselines/ folder of our linked code. Because running
GCP-Tables on all 390 prediction problems of the AutoML benchmark was economically infeasible (4h runs would total
over $30k), we only ran this AutoML tool on the first fold of each of the 39 datasets. All pairwise comparisons between
GCP-Tables and AutoGluon only consider the AutoGluon performance over this same fold, rather than all 10.
   5
     While a newer 0.6.0 auto-sklearn version exists, it has sckit-learn dependency that is incompatible with AutoGluon preventing
them from being installed together. There does not appear to be any updates to auto-sklearn’s ML/modeling process between versions
0.5.2 and 0.6.0

                             AutoGluon-Tabular: Robust and Accurate AutoML for Structured Data

We followed the protocol of the original AutoML Benchmark and trained frameworks with 1h and 4h time limits. The Kaggle
datasets tend to be larger than those of the AutoML Benchmark and posed memory issues for some of the baseline AutoML
tools. To ensure no AutoML framework is resource-limited, we ran the Kaggle benchmark for longer than the AutoML
datasets (4h and 8h time limits), and used more powerful AWS m5.24xlarge EC2 instances (384 GiB memory, 96 vCPU
cores). For the AutoML Benchmark, we used the same machine as in the original benchmark, an AWS m5.2xlarge EC2
instance (32 GiB memory, 8 vCPU cores).
To ensure averaging over different datasets remains meaningful in the AutoML Benchmark, we report loss values over
the test data that have been rescaled. We rescale the loss values for each dataset such that they span r0, 1s among our
AutoML frameworks. The rescaled loss for a dataset is set = 0 for the champion framework and = 1 for the worst-performing
framework. The remaining frameworks are linearly scaled between these endpoints based on their relative loss. To ensure all
head-to-head comparisons between frameworks remain fair, our reported averages/counts are taken only over those datasets
where all frameworks trained without error.

Table S3. Comparing our usage of AutoML systems against the results from the original AutoML Benchmark (Gijsbers et al., 2019). Out
of the 39 datasets, we count how often our implementation exceeded the original performance (ą), or fell below the original performance
(ă), or was equally performant (“). Since there were no ties here, all missing counts are datasets where one framework failed. Rather
than providing TPOT, auto-sklearn, and Auto-WEKA with information about the true feature types (as done in the original benchmark),
we instead provided them with data automatically preprocessed by AutoGluon. This allows these methods to be applied in a more
automated/robust manner to other datasets, without harming their performance.

C.1. AWS Sagemaker AutoPilot

Like GCP-Tables, Sagemaker AutoPilot is another cloud AutoML service which allows users to automatically obtain
predictions from raw data with a single API call or just a few clicks. It runs a number of algorithms and tunes their
hyperparameters on fully managed compute infrastructure, but does not utilize any model ensembling. At this time,
AutoPilot does not estimate class probabilities (only produces class predictions). In order to receive a score in our
benchmarks (log-loss, AUC, etc.), predicted class probabilities are needed. For that reason, we only included AutoPilot in
the raw accuracy comparison in Table S8.

D. Additional Results
This section contains the comprehensive set of results from all of our benchmarks.

D.1. Additional Results for AutoML Benchmark

Table S4. Comparing each AutoML framework against AutoGluon on the 39 AutoML Benchmark datasets (with 1h training time). Listed
are the number of datasets where each framework produced: better predictions than AutoGluon (Wins), worse predictions (Losses),
a system failure during training (Failures), or more accurate predictions than all of the other 5 frameworks (Champion). The latter 3
columns show the average: rank of the framework (among the 6 AutoML tools applied to each dataset), (rescaled) loss on the test data,
and actual training time. Averages are computed over only the subset of datasets/folds where all methods ran successfully. Recall that loss
on each test set is evaluated as 1 - AUC or log-loss for binary or multi-class classification tasks, respectively (lower = better). To ensure
averaging over different datasets remains meaningful, we rescale the loss values for each dataset such that they span r0, 1s among our
AutoML frameworks. The rescaled loss for a dataset is set = 0 for the champion framework and = 1 for the worst-performing framework.
The remaining frameworks are linearly scaled between these endpoints based on their relative loss.

Figure S1. Performance of AutoML frameworks relative to AutoGluon on each dataset from the AutoML Benchmark (under 4h training
time limit). Failed runs are not shown here (and we omit a massive loss of Auto-WEKA on cars as an outlier). Loss is measured via
1 ´ AUC for binary classification datasets (black text), or log-loss for multi-class classification datasets (purple text), and is divided by
AutoGluon’s loss here.

Figure S2. Actual training times of each framework in the AutoML Benchmark, which varied despite the fact that we instructed each
framework to only run for the listed time limit. Unlike AutoGluon, some frameworks vastly exceeded their training time allowance (TPOT
in particular). In these cases, the accuracy values presented in this paper presumably represent optimistic estimates of the performance
that would be achieved if training were actually halted at the time limit. Datasets are colored based on whether they correspond to a binary
(black) or multi-class (purple) classification problem.

Table S5. Ablation analysis of AutoGluon trained without various components on the AutoML Benchmark under 1h and 4h time limits.
The ablated variants of AutoGluon are defined in §4.3, columns are defined as in Table 2 (averaged columns are relative to this table and
should not be compared across tables). Even after 4h, the NoMultiStack variant cannot outperform the full AutoGluon trained for only 1h.

Table S6. Comparing the open-source AutoML frameworks over all 10 train/test splits of the AutoML Benchmark (with 4h training time
limit). These results are based on the average performance across all 10 folds. A framework failure on any of the 10 folds is considered an
overall failure for the dataset. Columns are defined as in Table 2, where averaged columns are relative to the particular table and should
not be compared across tables. AutoGluon outperforms all other frameworks in 27 of the 38 datasets (Dionis dataset is excluded from
this table because all frameworks failed on this massive dataset). When comparing with all 10 folds, we note AutoGluon has an even
better rank and rescaled loss than when evaluating on only the first fold (Table 2). Evaluating over 10 folds reduces variance and thus
frameworks are less likely to get a strong/poor result by chance.

Table S7. Comparing open-source AutoML frameworks on all 10 folds of the AutoML Benchmark (with 4h training time limit). We
include scores reported from the original AutoML Benchmark, indicated with (O). These results are based on the average performance
across all 10 folds. A framework failure on any of the 10 folds is considered an overall failure for the dataset. Columns are defined as in
Table 2, where the averaged columns are relative to the particular table and should not be compared across tables. AutoGluon outperforms
all other frameworks in 24 of the 39 datasets. Even without access to the original feature type information which was provided in the
original benchmark, AutoGluon is still able to outperform the other frameworks. Our runs of the other AutoML frameworks perform
similarly to their original results, indicating feature type information can be inferred effectively in most cases. Note that the original
runs failed fewer times than our runs. This is likely because the original AutoML Benchmark runs performed multiple retries of failed
frameworks in an attempt to get a result, which we did not consider here.

Table S8. Comparison of the AutoML frameworks on the AutoML Benchmark, evaluating the accuracy metric (with 1h training time
limit). Columns are defined as in Table 2. Rescaled misclassification rate is calculated in the same manner as rescaled loss, but applied
specifically to the accuracy metric. Here, we additionally compare with the commercial Sagemaker Autopilot framework described in
§C.1. All frameworks were optimized on AUC except for AutoPilot, which was optimized on accuracy. This demonstrates that while
AutoGluon performs the best in the primary evaluation metric, it also performs favourably on secondary metrics such as accuracy, even
compared to AutoPilot which optimized directly on accuracy.

Figure S4. Actual training times of each framework in the Kaggle Benchmark, which varied despite the fact that we instructed each
framework to only run for the listed time limit. Unlike AutoGluon, some frameworks vastly exceeded their training time allowance (TPOT
in particular). In these cases, the accuracy values presented in this paper presumably represent optimistic estimates of the performance
that would be achieved if training were actually halted at the time limit. The color of each dataset name indicates the corresponding task:
binary classification (black), multi-class classification (purple), regression (orange).

Figure S5. Predictive performance of open-source AutoML frameworks under different training time limits (Auto-WEKA not shown as it
exhibited outlying poor performance). Here we show the example of the allstate-claims dataset from the Kaggle Benchmark,
which is a regression task evaluated via the mean absolute error metric. Unlike the other frameworks, AutoGluon performance consistently
improves with longer time limits.

E. AutoML Failures

When designing AutoML solutions, it is not easy to ensure stability and robustness across all manner of datasets that may
be encountered in the wild. During our benchmarking process, we encountered various errors and defects in the tested
frameworks. These errors include out-of-memory errors, resource limit errors, column name formatting errors, frameworks
failing to generate models, frameworks failing to finish in their allotted time limit (and never stopping), data type inference
errors, errors due to too few training rows, errors due to too many features, errors due to too many classes, output formatting
errors, test data rows randomly shuffled during predictions, and many more. The results presented in this paper represent our
best effort to resolve and mitigate as many of these errors as possible.
Many existing AutoML frameworks attempt to simultaneously train many models in parallel on different CPUs, but this
leads to memory issues when working with large datasets. In contrast, AutoGluon simply trains each model one at a time,
preferring to leverage all available CPUs to reduce individual model-training times as much as possible. This makes a big
difference in practice. Both auto-sklearn and Auto-WEKA train models in parallel, and exhibited numerous memory issues
when we ran them on larger datasets with less powerful CPUs, despite the fact that AutoGluon worked fine in these settings.

E.1. Failures in AutoML Benchmark

Below is a breakdown detailing what types of errors each AutoML framework encountered in the AutoML Benchmark.
Oddly, certain frameworks would error on particular train/test splits while succeeding on other train/test splits of the same
dataset.

E.1.1. AutoGluon Failures

AutoGluon failed on 1 of the 39 datasets in the 4h runs (0 failures in the 1h runs). This dataset is Dionis. Dionis is a large
dataset of 416,188 rows, 61 features, and 355 classes. We note that no framework succeeded on all 10 folds of Dionis except
for AutoGluon with 1h time limit. Both of the commercial AutoML services we tried, GCP-Tables and AutoPilot, also
failed to produce a result for Dionis.
Due to AutoGluon’s multi-layer stacking, it generates 355 features per successful base model to use as input to the stackers.
While most of the models succeed or properly catch memory errors before they happen, the AutoGluon Neural Network does
not yet have such a safeguard in the version of AutoGluon used in our benchmarks. Therefore, AutoGluon would randomly
succeed or fail a fold depending on how much memory the neural network ended up using. AutoGluon 4h succeeded on
folds 0 and 1, but failed on fold 2 with an out-of-memory error that prevented the sequential completion of further folds.
Because not all 10 folds were ran, we report a total failure for AutoGluon on this dataset.

                           AutoGluon-Tabular: Robust and Accurate AutoML for Structured Data

E.1.2. GCP-Tables Failures

GCP-Tables failed on 14 of the 39 datasets.

 1. ValueError:           GCP AutoML tables can only be trained on datasets with >= 1000
    rows
     GCP-Tables has a limitation of requiring at least 1000 rows of training data. This caused failures on 5 datasets:
     Australian, blood-transfusion, cnae-9, credit-g, and vehicle.

 2. GoogleAPICallError:               None Too many columns:                 XXXX. Maximum number is:                  1000
     GCP-Tables has a limitation of requiring no more than 1000 features. This caused failures on 5 datasets: christine,
     dilbert, guiellermo, riccardo, Robert.

 3. AssertionError: GCP AutoML did not predict with all classes!                                          GCP returned
    40 of XXX classes!
     GCP-Tables appears to only return 40 classes’ prediction probabilities on multi-class classification problems with
     greater than 40 classes, despite being directly given log-loss as the evaluation metric to optimize for. Because not all
     class probabilities were returned, the log-loss would have been infinite, and thus we consider this a failure. This caused
     failures on 2 datasets: Helena, Dionis.

 4. GoogleAPICallError: None Missing label(s) in test split: target column
    contains 7 distinct values, but only 6 present. There must be at least one
    instance of each label value in every split.
     GCP-Tables failed on 1 dataset with this error: Shuttle. We suspect this is due to Shuttle having its least frequent class
     appear only 9 times in the training set, and GCP-Tables attempted to use 10% of the training data as test data which
     contained 0 instances of this rare class, causing the crash.

 5. GoogleAPICallError:               None INTERNAL
     GCP-Tables cryptically failed on 1 dataset, KDDCup09 appetency, despite training for the full 4h duration.

E.1.3. H2O AutoML Failures

H2O AutoML failed on 9 of the 39 datasets. Note that the errors listed here only account for the 4 hour runs.

 1. H2OConnectionError:               Local server has died unexpectedly.                         RIP.
     This error occurred on several of the larger datasets, and often only on a fraction of folds. It is a cryptic error and likely
     represents a large variety of potential root causes. This error occurred on 7 datasets: Albert, guiellermo, higgs, Jannis,
     jungle chess 2pcs raw endgame complete, KDDCup09 appetency, and riccardo.

 2. AssertionError:             H2O could not produce any model in the requested time.
     This error occurred on 1 dataset: Dionis.

 3. H2O trains far longer than requested
     This error occurred on 1 dataset: Helena. On 5 of the 10 folds, H2O trained for approximately 90,000 seconds (25
     hours), compared to the requested 4 hours. It is unknown why H2O only appears to have acted this way on one dataset
     and only on half of the folds, nor why it stopped training rather sharply at 90,000 seconds.

E.1.4. auto-sklearn Failures

auto-sklearn failed on 7 of the 39 datasets. Note that the errors listed here only account for the 4 hour runs.

                           AutoGluon-Tabular: Robust and Accurate AutoML for Structured Data

 1. auto-sklearn hard crashes with SegmentationFault
     This error occurred on 5 datasets: Airlines, Albert, blood-transfusion, Covertype, and kc1. While Airlines, Albert, and
     Covertype are all very large datasets where out-of-memory is a likely error reason, blood-transfusion is the smallest
     dataset in the benchmark, and is therefore an odd dataset to fail on for this reason. Furthermore, all 5 of these datasets
     did not hard crash in the 1h time limit runs. auto-sklearn had 0 such failures in the 1 hour runs. This indicates that
     auto-sklearn ran out of memory or ran out of disk space (750 GB disk allocated per run) by training too many or too
     large of models. This would explain the failure on blood-transfusion, given that auto-sklearn trains between 7,000 and
     10,000 models in a single hour on blood-transfusion.
 2. ValueError:          attempt to get argmin of an empty sequence
     This error indicates that auto-sklearn did not finish training any models. This error occurred on 1 dataset: Dionis.
 3. AssertionError:            found prediction probability value outside of [0, 1]!
     This error indicates that auto-sklearn somehow created a model which outputted a probability value outside of valid
     bounds. This error occurred on 1 dataset: phoneme. This interestingly only occurred on a single fold of phoneme, with
     all others succeeding.

E.1.5. TPOT Failures

TPOT failed on 9 of the 39 datasets. Note that the errors listed here only account for the 4 hour runs.

 1. TPOT never finishes training
     TPOT does not always respect time limits, and in some cases appears to take a far greater time to train or may even
     get permanently stuck. For these results, we gave each algorithm up to 3 times the allocated time to finish, and these
     datasets were still running for TPOT. Several of these runs continued to train for weeks without an indication of
     stopping. This error occurred on 4 datasets: Helena, KDDCup09 appetency, kr-vs-kp, and vehicle.
 2. RuntimeError:           A pipeline has not yet been optimized.                         Please call fit()
    first.
     This error occurs when TPOT has not finished training any models in the allocated time. This error occurred on 2
     datasets: Dionis and Robert. An interesting note is that while Robert trained for well over the requested time (Averaging
     21000 seconds), Dionis failed with this error on average in only 500 seconds, indicating that some internal error
     occurred with no models being fit.
 3. RuntimeError:           The fitted pipeline does not have the predict proba() function.
     This is a cryptic error due to TPOT being explicitly passed the AUC and log-loss evaluation metrics for binary and
     multi-class classification respectively. It appears that occasionally TPOT will construct an invalid pipeline which it
     selects as its final solution. This is likely a defect internally in TPOT, and only happens on a fraction of folds and
     seemingly at random. This error occurred on 3 datasets: credit-g, numerai28.6, and riccardo.

E.1.6. Auto-WEKA Failures

Auto-WEKA failed on 7 of the 39 datasets. Note that the errors listed here only account for the 4 hour runs.

 1. Auto-WEKA hard crashes with SegmentationFault
     Auto-WEKA does not safely handle memory in all instances, and this causes a hard-crash that prohibits the return
     of the exact exception message. This error occurred on 6 datasets: adult, Airlines, Dionis, guiellermo, riccardo, and
     Robert.
 2. MemoryError: Unable to allocate 2.70 GiB for an array with shape (522912, 99)
    and data type <U14
     This memory error occurred on 1 dataset: Covertype.

                            AutoGluon-Tabular: Robust and Accurate AutoML for Structured Data

  3. ValueError:         AutoWEKA failed producing any prediction.
     This memory error occurred on 1 dataset: Covertype. Note that Covertype had different errors depending on the fold,
     with 5 of the 10 folds succeeding.

E.1.7. AutoPilot Failures

AutoPilot failed on 12 of the 39 datasets.

  1. AssertionError: Could not complete the data builder processing job. The
     AutoML Job cannot continue. Failed Job Arn: arn:aws:sagemaker:XXX...
     Upon further inspection into the log files of these failed jobs, it is revealed that, like GCP-Tables, AutoPilot requires a
     minimum of 1000 rows of training data, and the datasets that failed in this manner all have less than 1000 training rows.
     This error occurred on 5 datasets: Australian, blood-transfusion, cnae-9, credit-g, and vehicle.
  2. AssertionError:            AutoPilot did not finish training any models
     AutoPilot failed to finish training any models in the allocated time. This error occurred on 5 datasets: Covertype,
     Fashion-MNIST, guiellermo, riccardo, and Robert.
  3. KeyError: "None of [Index([’false’, ’true’], dtype=’object’)] are in the
     [columns]"
     AutoPilot inferred labels with string values ’true’ and ’false’ to be 1 and 0 respectively. Upon returning the predictions,
     they were in the form 1 and 0, despite all other string type label values returning their original string names in the other
     datasets. Because the values were given as ’true’ and ’false’, but returned as ’1’ and ’0’, automatically processing these
     results will cause a crash to many systems attempting to use AutoPilot, and thus we consider it an error. This error
     occurred on 1 dataset: kc1.
  4. AssertionError: Could not complete the candidate generation processing job.
     The AutoML Job cannot continue. Failed Job Arn: arn:aws:sagemaker:XXX...
     This cryptic error was thrown less than 15 minutes into the run and likely indicates that the dataset was too large for the
     data processing functionality to handle without encountering errors. This error occurred on 1 dataset: Dionis.

E.2. Failures in Kaggle Benchmark

Below, we compile the list of AutoML failures observed in the Kaggle Benchmark, which prevented a framework from
producing predictions for the corresponding competition. AutoGluon exhibited no errors on any dataset under any of the
training time limits specified in this paper.

  1. H2O failed on the ieee-fraud-detection data with error:
     java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Test/Validation dataset has a
     non-categorical column ’dist1’ which is categorical in the training data
     However, these data appear correctly formatted, and all other AutoML frameworks ran successfully in this competition.
     A similar H2O error has been discussed in the Kaggle forums for this competition:
     https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/discussion/110643
  2. H2O failed on the walmart-recruiting-trip-type-classification data with error:
     AssertionError:           H2O could not produce any model in the requested time.
     Even increasing the allowed training time to 32 hours did not solve this issue.
  3. H2O failed on the santander-customer-transaction-prediction data under a 4h time limit, with
     repeated trials always producing the error:
     AssertionError:           H2O could not produce any model in the requested time.
     We note that 8h time limit was sufficient for H2O to produce predictions for this competition.

                          AutoGluon-Tabular: Robust and Accurate AutoML for Structured Data

 4. TPOT failed on the ieee-fraud-detection data with error:
    RuntimeError:           A pipeline has not yet been optimized.                         Please call fit()
    first.
    This error message could indicate TPOT has not had enough time to find any valid ML pipelines, but we found even
    greatly increasing the allowed TPOT runtime limit up to 32h did not solve this issue.
 5. Despite being given evaluation metrics that require probabilistic predictions (e.g. AUC, Log-Loss) for certain datasets,
    TPOT nonetheless occasionally failed with error:
    RuntimeError:           The fitted pipeline does not have the predict proba() function.
    By re-running TPOT, we managed to circumvent this issue and successfully produce predictions for each of the Kaggle
    datasets.
 6. GCP-Tables could not produce models for the santander-value-prediction-challenge competition
    because this data contains 4992 columns and GCP-Tables refuses to handle data with over 1000 columns.
 7. In some competitions, GCP-Tables occasionally failed to return predictions for every single test data point (presumably
    producing errors during inference for certain test rows). Because a prediction must be submitted for every test example
    in order to get a score from Kaggle, we simply imputed dummy predictions for these missing cases, using: the marginal
    probability distribution over classes in the training data for classification tasks, and the average y-value in the training
    data for regression tasks.
 8. GCP-Tables (8h) failed initially on the santander-customer-satisfaction data with error:
    google.api core.exceptions.GoogleAPICallError:                             None INTERNAL
    but was able to run successfully when retried.

 9. Auto-WEKA failed on the walmart-recruiting-trip-type-classification data with opaque error:
    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: A nominal attribute (feature2) cannot
    have duplicate labels (’(1.384628-1.384628]’)
    Note that after the AutoGluon preprocessing (including one-hot encoding of categoricals), all features were declared as
    numeric in the ARFF files provided to Auto-WEKA. When run for 24h, Auto-WEKA succeeded on this data, indicating
    this error is time-limit related. However, the resulting performance of the 24h Auto-WEKA run was very poor as it
    predicted certain classes with near-zero probability even though the specified evaluation metric is log-loss.
10. Auto-WEKA often performed poorly under the log-loss evaluation metric because it occasionally produced predicted
    probabilities = 0 for certain classes, which are severely penalized under this metric. We added a small  “1e-8 factor to
    such predictions to ensure finite log-loss values. Note that Auto-WEKA was always informed the log-loss would be
    used (via argument: metric = kBInformation), so why it produced such overconfident predictions is unclear.
